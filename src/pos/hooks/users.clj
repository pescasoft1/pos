;; =============================================================================
;; Validators
;; =============================================================================

;; Example validator function:
;; (defn validate-dates
;;   "Validates that end date is after start date"
;;   [params]
;;   (let [start (:start_date params)
;;         end (:end_date params)]
;;     (when (and start end)
;;       ;; Add your validation logic here
;;       nil)))  ; Return nil if valid, or {:field "error message"}

;; =============================================================================
;; Computed Fields
;; =============================================================================

;; Example computed field:
;; (defn compute-total
;;   "Computes total from quantity and price"
;;   [row]
;;   (* (or (:quantity row) 0)
;;      (or (:price row) 0)))
